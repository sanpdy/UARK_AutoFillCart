When determining which aspects of a shopping list are most important to a typical Walmart.com shopper, it helps to consider both universal priorities (like price and availability) and personalized considerations (like dietary needs or brand loyalty). Below is a breakdown of the most impactful data fields, along with rationale for why they tend to matter for identifying priorities on a user’s shopping list. Fields not included here may still be relevant for certain products or niche shopper preferences, but these are the strongest “signal” fields that consistently drive decision-making.
Most Impactful Fields
Price
Why It Matters: Price is almost always top-of-mind for shoppers: cost sensitivity and budget constraints make it a primary factor in deciding what goes into a cart.
How It Helps: Identifies deals, helps filter out higher-priced options, and surfaces best-value items.

Availability
Why It Matters: Shoppers won’t bother with items that are out-of-stock or unavailable for shipping/pickup in their area.
How It Helps: Ensures users see items they can actually purchase right now, reducing frustration and cart abandonment.

Fulfillment Speed
Why It Matters: Especially in an era of fast shipping and same-day pickup, how quickly an item can get to a shopper is a big deal. Many will prioritize items that arrive sooner or can be picked up the same day.
How It Helps: Surfaces items that match the user’s urgency—e.g., next-day delivery, in-store pickup, curbside, etc.

Brand
Why It Matters: Brand loyalty is extremely common, particularly for groceries, personal care, and household products. Shoppers often prefer certain brands due to trust, past experience, or perceived quality.
How It Helps: Quickly narrows choices for shoppers who want brand consistency or are open to “brand substitution” for cheaper options.

Customer Rating
Why It Matters: Social proof (ratings and reviews) strongly influences purchase decisions, especially for new or unfamiliar products.
How It Helps: Allows filtering out low-rated or less-trusted items, helps highlight “top-rated” choices.

Category
Why It Matters: A broad organizational bucket (e.g., “groceries,” “home goods,” “electronics”) that helps segment the shopping list for easy navigation.
How It Helps: Aids in structuring the search, grouping similar items together, and targeting relevant products.

Special Diet Needs
Why It Matters: Dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, keto) are often non-negotiable for many shoppers.
How It Helps: Filters products so users immediately see only items they can eat or want to eat, increasing satisfaction and reducing wasted time.

Nutritional Content
Why It Matters: Calorie counts, sugar/sodium content, macros, and more can be crucial for health-conscious shoppers.
How It Helps: Nudges purchases aligned with health goals or medical restrictions—e.g., low-sodium diets, diabetic-friendly options.

Walmart Cash Offers / Deals
Why It Matters: Many shoppers actively look for deals, coupons, or loyalty program benefits to stretch their budget.
How It Helps: Directly highlights opportunities to save money or earn rewards, incentivizing users to add certain items to their list.

Useful Secondary Fields
Form / Flavor / Meat Type / Preparation Method / Container / Packaged Meal Type

Why They Might Matter:
Form (e.g., powder vs. liquid detergent) or Flavor (e.g., barbecue vs. buffalo wings) can be important for product satisfaction.
Meat Type (e.g., chicken vs. beef) or Preparation Method (e.g., oven-ready vs. microwavable) is relevant for certain food products.
Container and Packaged Meal Type factor into convenience (e.g., single-serving vs. family-size).
Use Case: More niche or product-specific. These attributes help narrow choices based on personal preferences but aren’t always “universal” drivers.

Food Condition (fresh, frozen, canned)
Why It Might Matter: Shoppers with strong preferences (e.g., fresh produce only, or long shelf life) pay close attention.
Use Case: Particularly relevant for groceries; may not be top-tier for all products but crucial in certain categories.

Size Descriptor
Why It Might Matter: Bulk shoppers (e.g., large families) prefer big pack sizes, while single-person households want smaller quantities.
Use Case: Important for convenience and cost considerations (price per unit).

Benefit Programs (e.g., SNAP/EBT eligible)
Why It Might Matter: Some shoppers need to ensure their purchases are covered by specific benefit programs.
Use Case: Very relevant for that specific audience; not necessarily universal.

Retailer
Why It Might Matter: In a multi-merchant marketplace, a user might want to know who’s actually fulfilling the order (though on Walmart.com, this is often Walmart itself or an approved marketplace seller).
Use Case: More about trust and shipping standards for third-party sellers.

Gifting
Why It Might Matter: If items are gifts, packaging or gift-wrapping can be a factor.
Use Case: Only relevant in contexts where the shopper explicitly wants a gift option.

Putting It All Together
Core Drivers: Price, availability, fulfillment speed, brand, ratings, category, and special diet/nutrition are the “must-have” attributes for most shopping decisions.
Extra Filters: Product-specific variables (like flavor, container, or size) become important depending on the product type (e.g., groceries vs. electronics).
Niche Needs: Benefit programs, gifting options, or advanced details like “meat type” or “packaged meal type” can be essential for specific user segments.
