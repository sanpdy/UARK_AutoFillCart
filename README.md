# UARK_AutoFillCart
An AI-powered shopping assistant that reads a userâ€™s grocery list and automatically finds and adds matching items to a cart on platforms like Walmart. Built for the UARK AI Workshop, this project explores intelligent agent design, web automation, and real-world integration of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval techniques.
